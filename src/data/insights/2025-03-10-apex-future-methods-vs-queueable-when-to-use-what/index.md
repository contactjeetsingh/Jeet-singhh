In Salesforce, asynchronous processing plays a crucial role in executing long-running operations without delaying the user experience. Two of the most common approaches for handling asynchronous tasks are **Future Methods (@future)** and **Queueable Apex**. While both allow background execution, they have distinct use cases, advantages, and limitations.

In this blog, we will explore the differences between **Future Methods and Queueable Apex**, their ideal use cases, and when to choose one over the other.

## What Are Apex Future Methods?

Future methods in Apex allow you to **execute long-running operations asynchronously**. They are useful when you need to perform time-consuming tasks like **callouts to external services, complex calculations, or bulk DML operations** without blocking the current transaction.

#### Key Features of Future Methods:

- Run asynchronously in the background.
- Support **callouts to external APIs**.
- Do not return values.
- Cannot be chained (one future method cannot call another future method).
- Can only accept **primitive data types, collections, or sObjects as parameters** (not custom Apex classes).
- Governed by **a limit of 50 future method invocations per transaction**.

##### Example of a Future Method:

```
public class FutureExample {
    @future(callout=true)
    public static void processAccounts(Set accountIds) {
        List accounts = [SELECT Id, Name FROM Account WHERE Id IN :accountIds];
        for (Account acc : accounts) {
            acc.Rating = 'Hot';
        }
        update accounts;
    }
} 
```

In this example, the method runs asynchronously and updates accounts without blocking the user.

## What Is Queueable Apex?

Queueable Apex is an enhanced version of **Future Methods** that provides additional capabilities like **job chaining, complex object passing, and monitoring via the Apex Jobs queue**.

#### Key Features of Queueable Apex:

- Supports **chaining** (one queueable job can enqueue another).
- Can pass **complex objects** like custom Apex classes and sObjects.
- Allows **tracking via the Apex Jobs UI**, making it easier to monitor execution.
- Supports callouts, just like Future Methods.
- Governed by a limit of **one Queueable job per transaction** (but the first job can enqueue another).

##### Example of a Queueable Apex Class:

```
public class QueueableExample implements Queueable {
    public Set accountIds;
    public QueueableExample(Set accIds) {
        this.accountIds = accIds;
    }
    public void execute(QueueableContext context) {
        List accounts = [SELECT Id, Name FROM Account WHERE Id IN :accountIds];
        for (Account acc : accounts) {
            acc.Rating = 'Warm';
        }
        update accounts;
    }
} 
```

To enqueue this job from a trigger or another class:

```
 System.enqueueJob(new QueueableExample(new Set{'001XX000003DHPFQA4'})); 
```

This runs the job asynchronously while allowing **monitoring and chaining**.

## Future Methods vs Queueable Apex: Key Differences

| Feature | Future Methods (@future) | Queueable Apex |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Execution Mode** | Asynchronous | Asynchronous |
| **Supports Callouts?** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **Supports Chaining?** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (one job can enqueue another) |
| **Allows Complex Object Passing?** | ❌ No (only primitives, sObjects, and collections) | ✅ Yes (supports custom Apex objects) |
| **Monitoring in Apex Jobs UI?** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **Governor Limits** | Max **50 future calls per transaction** | Max **1 queueable job per transaction** (but can chain more) |
| **Use Case** | Lightweight async tasks, callouts, simple updates | Chained jobs, complex processing, large data handling |

## When to Use Future Methods vs Queueable Apex?

### **Use Future Methods When:**

✅ You need to perform a **simple asynchronous task**.  
✅ The method needs to make a **callout to an external system**.  
✅ You don’t need **chaining or monitoring**.  
✅ You want a quick and easy solution for background execution.

### **Use Queueable Apex When:**

✅ You need to **chain multiple jobs** for sequential execution.  
✅ The task involves **complex data structures**, including custom Apex objects.  
✅ You need **better visibility and tracking** of background jobs in the Apex Jobs UI.  
✅ The process involves **large-scale data operations**.

## Which One Should You Choose?

If you need **basic asynchronous execution**, such as making a single callout or performing simple updates, **Future Methods** are sufficient. However, if you need **chaining, tracking, or handling complex data**, **Queueable Apex is the better choice**.

For **scalable and maintainable code**, **Queueable Apex is generally preferred** over Future Methods because of its enhanced functionality.

## Conclusion

Both **Future Methods and Queueable Apex** are powerful tools for handling asynchronous processing in Salesforce. Future Methods are **simpler** and ideal for quick background tasks, while Queueable Apex offers **more flexibility, job chaining, and tracking**.

By understanding their **differences and best use cases**, you can optimize your **Salesforce automation processes** and ensure that your asynchronous jobs run efficiently without hitting governor limits.
