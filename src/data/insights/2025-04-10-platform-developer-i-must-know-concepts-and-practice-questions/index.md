If you’re planning to become a Salesforce Developer, the **Platform Developer I certification** is your essential first step. This credential validates your ability to write clean, scalable code on the Salesforce Platform using Apex, SOQL, and Lightning Components.

Whether you're just starting or transitioning from an admin role, this guide will help you focus on the most important concepts and get hands-on with practice questions to strengthen your preparation.

### What is Platform Developer I Certification?

The **Platform Developer I** certification measures your understanding of core Salesforce development skills — including Apex programming, data modeling, declarative automation, and basic user interface development. It is ideal for those who want to build custom apps, triggers, and integrations within Salesforce.

## Key Topics Covered in the Exam

Let’s break down the critical areas you need to focus on:

#### 1\. Apex Programming

You’ll need to master object-oriented programming in Apex. This includes writing classes, constructors, methods, and understanding the use of collections like `List`, `Set`, and `Map`.

#### 2\. SOQL and DML

You should know how to query Salesforce data using SOQL and perform DML operations such as `insert`, `update`, `delete`, and `upsert`, while following best practices to avoid hitting governor limits.

#### 3\. Triggers and Automation

Understand how to write triggers that are bulk-safe and follow a structured trigger framework. Know when to use **before** and **after** triggers based on use case and execution order.

#### 4\. Governor Limits

Salesforce imposes strict limits to maintain multi-tenancy. You must know how to optimize code to stay within these limits (like avoiding SOQL inside loops).

#### 5\. Data Modeling and Relationships

Learn how to define custom objects and fields, and design relationships using **lookup** and **master-detail** fields. Understanding schema design is critical for scalable apps.

#### 6\. Lightning Components and Visualforce

Even though Lightning Web Components (LWC) are growing in usage, the exam also tests Visualforce basics. You should understand how both can be used to build UIs.

#### 7\. Testing and Debugging

Writing test classes is essential. You must create unit tests that cover at least **75%** of your code, use `System.assert()` methods, and simulate different user and data scenarios.

#### 8\. Security and Access Control

Know how to handle record access, object permissions, CRUD, and field-level security using Apex. Understand how the `with sharing` and `without sharing` keywords work.

## Practice Questions

Try these sample questions to check your readiness:

##### Q1. What is the correct way to prevent a SOQL query from running inside a loop?

**Answer:** Move the SOQL query **outside** the loop and use a collection to store record IDs.

##### Q2. What does with sharing mean in an Apex class?

**Answer:** It enforces the sharing rules of the current user, restricting access based on record-level permissions.

##### Q3. When should you use an after trigger instead of a before trigger?

**Answer:** Use an after trigger when you need to access a record’s ID or perform actions after the record is committed (e.g., creating related records).

##### Q4. What collection would you use to prevent duplicate values and maintain high performance?

**Answer:** `Set` — it stores unique elements and is optimized for lookup operations.

## Tips for Success

- **Use a Developer Org** to write and test Apex code regularly.
- Focus on **writing clean, bulk-safe code**.
- Go through the official exam guide and understand the weightage of each section.
- Practice **test classes and code coverage** — aim for more than 85%.
- Use flashcards for syntax, best practices, and key definitions.

## Next Steps

Mastering the Platform Developer I concepts takes practice and focus. Whether you’re aiming to build your first Salesforce app or level up your developer career, a solid foundation in these topics is crucial.
