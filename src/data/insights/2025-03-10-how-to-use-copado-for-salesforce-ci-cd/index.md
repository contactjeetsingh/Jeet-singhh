As Salesforce development becomes more complex, **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)** have become essential for managing releases efficiently. **Copado**, a leading Salesforce DevOps platform, helps teams automate deployments, track changes, and improve collaboration. It provides a **user-friendly, low-code solution** that allows admins and developers to implement **CI/CD pipelines with version control, automated testing, and compliance tracking**.

In this blog, we’ll walk through **how to use Copado for Salesforce CI/CD**, covering key features, setup, and best practices.

## Why Use Copado for CI/CD in Salesforce?
