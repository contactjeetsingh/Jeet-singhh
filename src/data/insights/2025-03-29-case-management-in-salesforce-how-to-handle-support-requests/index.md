With Case Management, support teams can efficiently manage cases, collaborate with other teams, and ensure timely resolution. The platform also provides tools for automation, reporting, and analytics, making it easier to optimize your support operations.

### Code Examples for Case Management Automation

Here are some code snippets to help you automate and customize your case management process:

#### 1\. Automate Case Assignment with Apex

```
trigger CaseAssignmentTrigger on Case (before insert) {
for (Case c : Trigger.new) {
// Assign cases based on priority
if (c.Priority == 'High') {
c.OwnerId = '005XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'; // ID of the high-priority queue or user
} else if (c.Priority == 'Medium') {
c.OwnerId = '005YYYYYYYYYYYYYYY'; // ID of the medium-priority queue or user
} else {
c.OwnerId = '005ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ'; // ID of the low-priority queue or user
}
}
}
```

#### 2\. Automate Email Notifications with Process Builder

1. Create a new Process on the Case object.
    
2. Set the trigger to "When a record is created or updated."
    
3. Add an action to send an email notification to the case owner when the status changes to "Escalated."
    

#### 3\. Create a Flow for Case Escalation

1. Create a **Record-Triggered Flow** on the Case object.
    
2. Set the trigger condition to "When a record is updated."
